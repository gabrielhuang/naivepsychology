            <h2>Revisiting the Id, Ego, and Superego</h2>
            <h3>Freud's model</h3> 
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego">id, ego, and superego model</a> is a psychiatric model generally attributed to Sigmund Freud,
            which factorizes human behavior into an animal-like and impulsive part (id), a rational action taker (ego), and the need to satisfy external rules (superego).</p>

            <h3>Revisiting the id and ego</h3> 

            <p>Here I present my own interpretation of these terms, which differ slightly from the usual definition because I think they are a more interesting factorization from a modeling persepective using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement-learning</a> (RL) framework. 
            Rather than distinguishing them based on impulsivity (id) vs. rationality (ego), I prefer to distinguish them as the reward function (id) vs. the agent which attempts to optimize such a reward (ego).
            Concerning the superego, my model does not consider it to be a separate agent in the brain. Rather, the superego is the process by which societal norms and expectations are internalized into our id and unconsciously tied to our emotions.</p>

            <p>The <b>id</b> is our animal-like part or child-like part, and it's what distinguishes us from machines. 
            It is the receptacle of all our emotions, including cravings and aversions, and is the driving force behind all our actions (under our model). The id:<br>
            - makes us feel alive.<br>
            - is the driving force behind *all* our actions<br>
            - generates our impulses, spontaneous desires, and emotions, but is not necessarily what causes them<br>
            - doesn't think in logical terms, and is more of a reactive nature. <br>
            - doesn't really have a notion of time like the ego, and cannot model the future.<br>
            - rather, the id remembers the past indirectly by generating various emotions depending on the situation.<br>
            - the id changes slowly, and is a product of our genetics and past experiences.<br>
            - the id be influenced, but only gradually, and over time.</p>

            <p>Below is an illustration of how the id and ego fit together to generate human behavior. Basically, the id feels a bunch of emotions all the time, which are either perceived as positive (e.g. joy, excitment) or negative (e.g. frustration, anger). All those emotions aggregate (thinkâ€“weighted sum) into a single scalar, which expresses our level of happiness/well-being.
            The ego notices the current level of happiness, and attempts to improve current and future levels of happiness, according to simulations it runs inside our brain.
            Those simulations might not be optimal, nevertheless they

            <h3>Does the superego exist?</h3> 

            For me, the superego is not an agent inside the brain.
