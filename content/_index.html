  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <h3>Approach</h3>

    <p>This is a space to share my naive and spontaneous thoughts on <b> how humans think, feel and interact with each other</b>.
    Being a <a href="https://gabrielhuang.github.io/">machine learning</a> practitioner interested in the impact of AI on society, I am constantly learning and trying to unify various perspectives from
     <i>machine learning, reinforcement learning, behavior science, affective modeling, psychology, sociology, organizational behavior, ethics/moral philosophy, economics, geopolitics, policy analysis, marketing, mindfulness, psychonautics</i>.

    <p> Here are my long-term <b>goals</b>:
    <ol>
      <li>Understand and model the <b>human decision process</b>.</li>
      <li>Understand and model how <b>societies emerge</b> from individual behavior (human and AI).</li>
      <li>Explore all the ways <b>AI</b> will <b>impact</b> points 1 and 2.</li>
      <li>Design <b>AI systems aligned with our core values</b>.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

    <h3>From individual behavior to society</h3>

    <p>My fundamental assumption is that as humans, we <b>make decisions</b> based solely on two things: our <b>emotions</b> and <b>values</b>.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>At the lowest level, we are <b>mammals with emotions</b> (I include instincts in them). Our emotions emerged through evolution to optimize our survival as a species. 
    We are wired to take actions to maximize pleasure (positive emotions) and minimize our own suffering (negative emotions), in the short-term (immediate cravings and aversions)
    but also in the longer term, thanks to our advanced planning abilities. </li>
    <li>At a higher level, being Homo Sapiens, we have a developed (neo)cortex, which allows us to reason (to some extent) about the long-term consequences of our decisions.
      We always take the actions which yield the most <b>positive</b> outcomes with respect to our (current) <b>personal value/moral belief system</b>.
      This value system is subjective, and emcompasses our deepest convictions (it's not just mere opinions) about what is right (good) and what is wrong (bad).
      Each person's value system can be described as the relative importance they attribute to general values such as: security, material comfort, freedom, fairness, human life, quality of relations, art and beauty.
    </li>
  </ul>

  Free will exists in the sense that we are free to take suboptimal actions with respect to our value system. However, it's much <b>harder to change</b> (or even be aware of) our value system.
  <blockquote>"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." 
    Baruch Spinoza, Ethics
  </blockquote>

  <p>It's <b>possible to change our values</b>, though. In fact, our values change naturally over time—as we age (priorities change), interact with various people (peer influence and social pressure), create emotional and legal bounds (e.g., marriages and children), 
  as our environment and surroundings change (immigration, wars, natural disaster, social evolution), and as we go to school and work (specific values are rewarded and/or internalized).
  Change can also be forced or accelerated using <b>marketing</b> (commercial purpose) and <b>propaganda/disinformation</b> (political purpose), which leverage an arsenal of techniques to manipulate our beliefs and values within a <b>sociotechnical</b> system,
  for <i>better</i> or <i>worse</i>.</p>
  
  <p><mark>Notice the mind-boggling paradox—how can we trust our beliefs to judge an ideology/lifestyle/worldview/product, if our beliefs themselves can be manipulated by the entities (corporate and political forces) who want to be judged favorably?
  </mark></p>

  <!-- find concrete example here -->
  <p>There is no easy answer to this question, because values will always be arbitrary (they cannot be mathematically defined).
  However, we can try to clarify our beliefs by reducing them to a small set of <b>primary (core) values</b>, upon which different <b>secondary</b> values and <b>ideologies</b> can be derived—through logical steps and policy analysis— depending 
  on the relative importance of the core values. 
  Once we decide (purely subjectively/axiomatically) which core values to care about, the judgement process reduces to asking whether the ideology/lifestyle/worldview/product is consistent with them.
</p>

  <p>
  For good reasons, this approach is one of the founding principles of modern democracies. Core values are encoded in the <b>Constitution</b>, from which secondary values (laws) are derived. 
  Small courts judge people's actions based on laws (secondary values), and when there is disagreement, the Supreme Court determines whether laws are constitutional (consistent with core values).
  Just like core values, the Consitution is slow and hard to change. However, in both cases, there are ways to reform both whenever they become out of touch with our current sociotechnical realities
  —for instance, when a disruptive technology significantly reshapes society by changes the balance of powers, the way people connect, the nature of social interactions, social expectations,
  or changes social selection mechanisms. 
</p>

Every time a disruptive technology changes the world, we should be mindful that corporations and political parties will be quick to adapt their manipulation techniques to the new sociotechnical infrastructure, 
simply because they have every incentive to do so for their own growth and survival. 




    <p>I will explore the human at three different scales. Starting from the <a href="#individual">individual human mind</a>, I will expand to small-group <a href="#tribal">tribal dynamics</a>, then to large-group <a href="#societal"> social dynamics</a> such as the ones imposed by culture, rules, social constructs, and the dominant ideologies.</p>

    <p> I will share my <i>insights</i> and <i>takeaways</i> as I learn more about <u>behavior science, personality traits and profiles, psychology & sociology, values and ethics, public policy, economics, geopolitics, and mass-manipulation</u>. In parallel, I will attempt to develop a simplified model of <b>human behavior</b> and <b>social dynamics</b> and ground it into concepts and paradigms from <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html">reinforcement learning</a> research. Doing that, I hope to discover new research directions for <b>AI decision-making</b>, and improve my understanding of <b>humans and the societies(s)</b> they have built.</p>

  <!-- 
  Given infinite time and resources, my "dream" is to simulate an AI society, which will then build its own AI society and so on and so forth, leading to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">AI singularity</a>. I also hope to learn how to steer the world towards a sustainable future.

  <p class="lowkey"><small>Note: I will not be rigorous nor cite the literature exhaustively. Many of my ideas will seem as naive or outright wrong (sorry, Reviewer #2).
    However, I will try to ground every idea either in scientific/casual readings or in my own physical, mental, and spiritual experiences. Also, this is a constant work in progress, so expect broken links and the like.</small></p>
