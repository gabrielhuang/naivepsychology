<!-- title: Revisiting the Id, Ego, and Superego -->

### Freud's model

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego">id, ego, and superego model</a> is a psychiatric model theorized by Sigmund Freud. The human mind is factorized into an animal-like and impulsive part (id), a rational action taker (ego), and the need to satisfy external rules (superego).

### Revisiting the id and ego

Here I present my own interpretation of these terms, which <a href="#differ">differ</a> slightly from the usual definition.

#### Id – the animal part

The <b>id</b> is our animal-like part or child-like part, and to me, it's what distinguishes us from cold-blooded machines. 
It is the <b>receptacle</b> of all our emotions and feelings, and transforms those mental concepts into physical sensations, which we experience through our body (if we are connected enough, that is). When we say that we our happy, we really mean that our id is happy. 
Likewise, when we say we are angry, afraid, surprised, sad, or disgusted, we mean that our id is experiencing those emothings.
Therefore, to be happy, we must make our id happy.
<!-- Aversion and cravings, the two great sources of human suffering according to the Buddha, also lead to discomfort in the id.  -->

Here are some more characteristics of the id:
<ul>
    <li>The id is directly connected to our <b>body sensations</b>, and is what ``feels''. It experiences physical sensations and reacts to various emotions by <b>causing</b> physical sensations.</li>
    <li>We <b>feel alive</b> because of the physical sensations experienced by the id, both external (outside stimuli) and internal (emotional stimuli).</li>
    <li>The id can <b>transform emotions</b> into physical sensations, which we experience in our body in the same way as we experience external stimuli.</li>
    <li>The id <b>drives all our actions</b>, directly through spontaneous desires leading to impulsive actions, and indirectly through the action of the ego runs simulations on the best way to satisfy the id.</li>
    <li>The id <b>doesn't "think"</b>, and certainly not in logical terms. It cannot plan, structure, or organize. In fact, it has <b>no notion of time</b> and <b>cannot model the future</b>. Rather, it reacts emotionally to situations (recalled, present, or projected).
        This means it can remember the past indirectly by associating various emotions to certain situations (recalled, present, or projected).
    </li>
    <li>The id changes slowly, and is a product of our <b>genetics</b> and <b>past experiences</b>. It can be influenced, but only gradually and over time.</li>
</ul>

#### Ego – the problem solving part

The ego is the <b>rational problem-solver</b> inside our mind. When <mark>we</mark> say that <i>we</i> need to make our id happy to be happy, we really mean that our <mark>ego</mark> needs to make our id happy.
The ego finds the sequence of actions (strategy) to make the id happy, within the physical and social constraints of our reality. When the ego cannot make the id happy, we feel <b>frustrated</b> (the id or the ego?)


Here are some more characteristics of the ego:
<ul>
    <li>When we say that someone is smart we usually mean that their ego is smart. The IQ attempts to measure the problem-solving abilities of the ego.</li>
    <li>When we say that someone is smart we usually mean that their ego is smart.</li>
</ul>



#### RL model – problem solver vs. reward setter

Basically, the id feels a bunch of emotions all the time, which are either perceived as positive (e.g. joy, excitment) or negative (e.g. frustration, anger). All those emotions aggregate (think–weighted sum) into a single scalar, which expresses our level of happiness/well-being.
    The ego notices the current level of happiness, and attempts to improve current and future levels of happiness, according to simulations it runs inside our brain.
    Those simulations might not be optimal, nevertheless they
    

The following model may contradict some of the previous points, but I like it for the reason that it factorizes id and ego into reward function setter (id) and problem solver (ego). An important problem in reinforcement-learning is how to define interesting rewards that will lead to learning interesting agents. Indeed, which RL researcher hasn't wondered what is the ultimated reward function that will lead to the emergence of human consciousness and intelligence?


Here is an illustration of how the id and ego fit together to generate human behavior.
