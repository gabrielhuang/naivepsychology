<!-- title: Democratic Game (notes) -->
<!-- date: 2022-02-10 -->

In the democratic game, the candidate who maximizes people's preferences is chosen during presidential elections.
Which means, people get to decide for themselves who is best for them. this only works well if people have enough and accurate information, and can do critical thinking (education).
-> If they are educated, then they make a rational choice to maximize their id's needs. actually, they should be (self)-educated in policy.
-> If they're not educated, they will pick candidates more on a gut-feeling. Who do I like the most? Who is the most personable? Which is probably what you would do in real life. Who would I hang out with more? Who has a good vibe?

So, instead of the democratic ideal of everyone making the best rational choice for themselves, it's a mix between that and picking the most popular candidate. Therefore the election results can become more a matter of who uses logical thinking vs. pure raw intuition, and then winning the second group over. Is it a good idea to have a "policy-analysis coach"/"vote educator" available? Or would that be too much potential for hacking?

The president is supposed to be the candidate which satisfies the maximum amount of citizens 
-> so the opinions of the minorities are purely discarded.
-> so it's only for the citizens (exluding completely non-citizens).

Actually, the media can make it better for the minorities by amplifying their needs through (social) media.
-> so the majority of people hear more about those issues, creating awareness, and hopefully, rational thinking about that issue, leading to a small adjustment of voting preferences for the future.
-> but there again, it becomes a popularity contest of winning (media) attention.

Campaigns that trigger strong emotions (nationalism is perfectly on point), will tend to be more viral. 
-> nationalists are more at risk because anything that touches on the national pride (looking at you China) creates stronger emotional reaction.
-> that tended to backfire with anti-Japanese sentiment in China, when protestors started vandalizing japanese cars and companies. eventually  <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/nationalism-and-china-japan-island-disputes</a>">the troops were sent</a>

So anyways, you have your solution for fixing democracies. 
-> Educate people in the most critical thinking way possible, no "doublespeak" (1984) or gut feeling decisions, but rational reflexes and instincts in the simplest way, one after another, in a way that they can better tell if anyone is lying to them or just very likable but without a program that actually benefits them.
-> Sufficiently educated people must keep the government accountable and in check, with actual separation of powers. Their actions must be aligned with the democratic intent.
-> Develop people's empathy, so that people across the political spectrum can at least understand each other at an intellectual and intuitive level (instead of misunderstanding, fear, and anger). But more importantly, this ensures people's values remain sufficiently aligned with "the greater good".
-> Having quality news media with adequate funding to prevent them from disappearing under capitalism.

listen more to each other with an open mind instead of feeling anger and fear (looking at you, the Internet! you destabilized democracy as we know it.) And then, you'll try to work out a solution that satisfies the most people.

Could we have a form of cyber-democracy? Or would it make it even worse? If people could write or modify new law propositions, and people could comment, upvote or downvote them. The question is, would the government be like stackoverflow (good and usefulf) or reddit (a mix of good and useful with just random stuff to waste your time) ?

You know what else makes people more angry than average? Driving in traffic.



Social media is so much worse
-> instead of reaching everyone, ideas only reach those with similar ideologies, creating a dynamic of ideological clusters (echo chambers), which will tend to gravitate towards stronger beliefs, since stronger emotions gather more sentiment. This is not usually a problem at the scale of a country, when there's only one cluster.

With a populist approach, they grab your attention on issues of:
- unfairness
- fear of losing something (craving), aversion

Not all populist candidates are bad. I think given the current implementation of democracy, it's only fair game to get the other half of intuitive voters.

Don't you think it's crazy citizens tend to treat each other decently, but when it comes to other countries, especially non-allies, geopolitics is  played much like a chess game? Like, sure, be nicer to your "allies". But when it comes to "ennemies". The geopolitical game is brutal. It's pretty much – "there's no rules!". Make up your own, only if you will. That means wars is on the table, potentially with mass-scale violence and killings.But now, if you have that inside a nation-state, then you pretty much have a civil war.

Why can't the world just be a giant state? And then there would be no wars. The problem is that all these people and territories can't agree on a common ideology. If they could, wouldn't they just?

Question: If your citizens don't pay you taxes, can you still consider yourself a (federal) government? Are their alternative modes of governance (digital?)

HOW TO DEFINE TRUTH?
Can truth we defined mathematically? Science needs to be a value. Anything science is one that can either be proved to be true, or a least a good model by showing that many predictions can be true.
-> Don't pick a tiny test set though! That's what anecdotes are no? Cherry-picked example individuals or individual examples to serve an alternative rhetoric. Essentially adversarial example.

For pure facts, the answer is easy, and it is science.
But for values, it seems extremely hard to define values (or is it?). What we have to be careful is not to let the leaders only define value, otherwise this top-down approach will lead to a totalitarian communist-style regime.
Democracies at least create checks and balances (feedback loop) so that citizens have contorls over their leaders. Divide an conquer. Ensure fair competition between candidates, but also among the electorate.

How to define the truth? Logical truth is when things follow the laws of logic, based on facts. Good journalism should verify facts and present them in context using the laws of logic. How biased can the context better?

An interesting exercise would be to try to guess which values each media article tries to promote.

Example values:

Loyalty
Spirituality
Humility
Compassion
Honesty
Kindness
Integrity
Selflessness
Determination
Generosity
Courage
Tolerance
Trustworthiness
Equanimity
Altruism
Appreciation
Empathy
Toughness
Self-Reliance
Attentiveness

about addiction
What mattered more than how the patients felt physically was their level of what the researchers call “distress intolerance,” a measure of how much “fear and anxiety at the prospect of physical or emotional distress” the patients felt. Their inability to handle their fear of pain was a greater factor correlating with drug addiction than the pain they actually experienced.

Minimum Enjoyable Action: example: floss one tooth. "duh test"

Capitalism: trust the consumer. But that doesn't work. The consumer doesn;'t know always what's best for themselves, starting from ...


Who should decide the values?

What are the checks and balances of companies? Only money. But consumers allocate their money (thus, power and resources by proxy) after being influenced by marketing. That's why limiting marketing is a necessary step for a fair environment, otherwise companies which value profit the most, with little to no core values, 




I top-down approach would be catastrophic!

A well-functioning state should promote:
-> important values of compassion and love to its candidates [the only right intrinsic meta-ideology. does that make sens or there's no mathematical description of the best values and ideology???]
-> rational thinking skills and ability to explain that logic in simple terms
-> populism training. Or maybe not. Maybe it should have the most boring candidates? Nah! Nobody would care about politics then. 
Candidates need to take a mandatory "explain to me like I'm 5" training, and should be held as accountable of their actions as possible.

Can one compute the optimal ideology for the world?
-> Crazy idea. If right now, we made up a system where every person in the world could explain their needs to an algorithm, vote and choose to repartition the earth

Egoisme? My way is the best way? Individualistic humanist? You let your it drift. Feels nice. But will it go somewhere "good"? 
-> and again, can we define "good" mathematically? of course not. but is there a minimal set of values, from which one can reconstruct the optimal strategy for this world? probably?

The Humanist Ideology:
-> every life (what's dead, euthanasia issues?) of a human (pretty hard to negociate, unless you're a hardcore racist nowadays) is worth the same (how do you define these–abortion issues?) ?
-> the opinion of everyone is the optimal rational choice for themselves (true only to various degrees).

Democracy shortcomings:
-> Promotes selfishness. everyone can just vote in their self-interest. that tends to be the natural reaction if acting as a selfish economical agent, which is typically what the economists assume. if the US fixed their values of selfishness maybe things would be better?



We need to promote more love and empathy. Drugs are a debatable way of doing that, preferably through a legal route. Imagine medecine that would increase your sense of empathy, like by boosting your serotonine levels, but without any detrimental side-effects and without addiction potential. Otherwise, there are many: culture (and I mean real culture, living with people and understanding their values at the most intuitive level, not the bullshit you experience on vacation)

Promote the correct gut-feeling about what's true and what's untrue. Just like this author (ask JP again about him) is trying to convey intuition on the scale of changes to climate,


For a second, I had the thought that a "fact translator/checker" would only appeal the the already reational people, whether it will appeal to the intuitive voters boils down again to a question of marketing.


Are states just literally geographical and ideological clusters? When the two partinionings overlap or disagree, that might lead to interesting movements of division or merging.

Why couldn't it just be a let's be good neighbors game instead?


Things like "White Lives Matter" which catalyze on the sentiment that one is left out in their own country, creates a sense of unfairness and a strong emotional reaction. Videos of the movement become viral. And there you go, you have your electorate for the next elections.

Who has self-interests in mass-manipulation of opinions, values, worldviews and ideologies?
1. candidates, for more votes in order to win the election
2. private companies, for more profit

Is it wrong to do some marketing with a rational candidate? Why does it always feel like the right wing is against the poorest people?

The problem is that less educated are worse at making an educated guess

Good values must use the same tools as the evil. Marketing. Led by money.


which has the core value that the maximum amount of citizens (problems?) must be satisfied (see already the problem here, minorities will be fucked),
the candidates must play a popularity (problem?) contest (problem or good?).

School: pure ego training.
Work: pure ego use.
Family: id, ego, superego.

Superego = the dad?
